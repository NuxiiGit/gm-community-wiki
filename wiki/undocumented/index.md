# Undocumented Features

While GameMaker Studio 2 has some [good documentation](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/), there remains features that are poorly documented or entirely undocumented, leaving it to developers to figure out on their own.  This section of the wiki attempts to document some of those undocumented features.

If you find any features that are poorly explained by the official documentation (or entirely unexplained), please [contribute them](../contributing). to the wiki!
