# GMCW Browser Search

GMCW provides a search facility that most browsers can use to search GMCW directly from the address bar of the browser without having to first visit the site. This provides quick access to searching GMCW's wiki, documentation, and resources.

## Chrome
Simply visiting GMCW with Chrome makes it available in search, simply start typing `gmcw` and hit tab when Chrome prompts you with "Press Tab to search GMCW".

You are now in "Search GMCW" mode, allowing you to type a search query, and be sent to the GMCW search page for it. The URL bar will also suggest auto-complete or related search terms.

This will enable the GMCW search engine as an option when searching. To receive auto-completion, you additionally need to go into Settings > Search, and add a `@gmcw` keyword to the GMCW Search Engine

Once this is added, starting a search term with "@gmcw" will put you in "Search with GMCW" mode, and will suggest auto-complete or related search terms.
